#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/IE3KVidzk88>
#### Description: PIC-FINDER is a web application that helps you locate yourself in a folder of pictures. It is particularly useful for identifying your presence in photos from events, parties, or gatherings.

## Features
#### **Face Recognition**: The application uses face recognition to identify your face in the uploaded pictures. You can upload a folder of pictures, and the application will determine if you are present in any of them.
#### **Users**: Each user has their unique account containing pictures of themselves that the AI uses to detect them in other photos

## Prerequisites

#### **Python (version 3.9)**
